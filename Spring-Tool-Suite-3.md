## Important note

The Spring Tool Suite 3 is the previous generation of the Spring tooling for the Eclipse IDE. The Spring Tool Suite distribution was based on the Eclipse JEE package and included the Spring IDE components, the tc Server integration for Eclipse, and various other pre-installed plugins for the Eclipse IDE.

With the release of the all-new Spring Tools 4, the Spring Tool Suite 3 got deprecated and is no longer under active development. Instead, users of the Spring Tool Suite 3 are highly encouraged to migrate to the all-new Spring Tools 4: https://spring.io/tools. Even though the new Spring Tools 4 are IDE-agnostic and available for various development tools, we continue to provide a ready-to-use Eclipse-based distribution with the necessary components pre-installed.

In case you can't migrate to the Spring Tools 4, please let us know and provide feedback about what you are missing within the new tools, what doesn't work for you, or what other issues you face. In such a case, please file an enhancement request at: https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues. You can flag them, for example, as  "sts3-feature-request" to make clear that this is something that you miss from the old tools.

For your convenience, we still update the Spring Tool Suite 3 to the latest Eclipse distributions and will probably continue to do that for a little while (based on community feedback and demand). You can find the download links below. But please keep in mind to migrate to the new Spring Tools 4, since we will not be able to update the Spring Tool Suite 3 distribution forever.

## Migrate to Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse

The Spring Tools 4 wiki contains a small migration guide, please take a look at it: https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/STS3-Migration
